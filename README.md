**Week One** - *28/01/2019*<br>
<br>
At the momemnt I am considering working with recordings of different enviroments and using sensors to manipulate sound and/or Video.<br>
I would like to work with as many natural sounds as possible such as trees/sticks etc. I will likley record some sounds from Thetford foret for this.<br>
<br>
Maybe incorporate a Virtual Reality headset where a picture/video is manipulated by the sensors as well as the sounds.<br>
<br>
I may also consider adding some heavy breathging soundeffects to add to the realism. <br>
If I were to do this I may decide to use it to imitate some for of mental health issue. <br>
<br>
**Week Two** - *04/02/2019*<br>
After doing some research last week on Virtual Reality. I have realised that this may be a bit to difficult for me to achieve and so have decided to drop that aspect. I do however want to continue th eIdea of working with recording of nature and enviroments.
