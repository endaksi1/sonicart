**Week One** - *28/01/2019*<br>
At the momemnt I am considering working with recordings of different enviroments and using sensors to manipulate sound and/or Video.<br>
I would like to work with as many natural sounds as possible such as trees/sticks etc. I will likley record some sounds from Thetford foret for this.<br>
<br>
Maybe incorporate a Virtual Reality headset where a picture/video is manipulated by the sensors as well as the sounds.<br>
<br>
I may also consider adding some heavy breathging soundeffects to add to the realism. <br>
If I were to do this I may decide to use it to imitate some for of mental health issue. <br>

**Week Two** - *04/02/2019*<br>
After doing some research last week on Virtual Reality. I have realised that this may be a bit too difficult for me to achieve and so have decided to drop that aspect. I do however want to continue the Idea of working with recording nature type and enviroments.<br>

**Week Three** - *11/02/2019*<br>
Inspired by the work of Jana Winderen and Emeka Ogboh, I have choosen to make my sonic art piece using soundscape type sounds and recordings, whilst also trying to keep certain elements inline with contemporary Electronic dance music. I also like the idea of creating a video that is similaer to the videos that Emeka Ogboh creates as a way to increase the immersivness of the piece.<br>

I like the idea of working on this piece as I feel that contemprary Dance music can be very synthetic, which could be pulling peoples attention away from the real world. This is seen very much in a visual sense also as many people choose to spend more and more time consuming digital media such as video games etc.. I feel that EDM may be doing a similar thing in the sense that many of the sounds that are used are not heard in the naturel would.<br>
